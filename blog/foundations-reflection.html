        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h1>
      <p>
        ive learnt that when I put my mind to it I can acheive quite alot I used
        to put in minimal effort at school just enough too pass with but am now
        actively trying to learn new things.<br />
        Another thing that ive learnt is that I dont enjoy being stuck at a
        computer all day unless I have consitent and ample breaks aswell as
        finding out that music helps me a lot when doing work.<br />
        Something I noticed about my ego was that when I get stuck it doesnt
        damage my ego and instead I just want to fix it.

      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        the role of empathy in coding is to understand others problems and be
        able too help them overcome this especially when you were previously
        stuck on said problem and can offer assistance.<br />
        the role of self-awareness in learning is that you can realise when
        helps needed and being able to also see what you are actually trying to
        write in programming can help solve problems.<br />
        a way to be self aware could be the rubber ducky method where you speak
        something through what youve written and why can help make you aware of
        problems.

      <h2>
        What has surprised and challenged you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I expected the core activitys to be almost entirely with other people
        but core activitys seem to be about personal improvement mainly.<br />
        the most challenging parts of core learning were the personal values and
        activitys similair to that were difficult to answer for me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think that devacademy focuses on cotre activitys alot because being
        able to complete all the core activitys requires personal reflection
        aswell as collaberation with others which is a skill greatly desired in
        the industry.<br />
        I also think that alot of the personal core activitys increase our
        ability to control emotions and thoughts that can help us too complete
        work whilst under alot of pressure.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think that core activitys were usefull to have as they gave me a
        better understanding of how I should try attack problems both in code
        and out.<br />
        I think that it was worth taking a few hours out off coding every week
        to do the core activitys and reflect on that weeks workload.
