        Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice. Growing up
        with a disability I had to think about how to do things with the
        abilities I had this resulted in my mind working in a methodical and
        logical way.

        1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
        how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
        you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. Ethical decision
        Cutting of a bully from my life He used to steal from all my friends and
        beat up another kid in friend group towards the end Had to weigh up
        letting a bad friend have no friends and peace for me and friends I
        reflect on it and that was the best option. the values I brought out of
        this were that treating others with respect and dignity are really
        important to me aswell as helping those who need it is very important to
        me.

        2.Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity. My mum helped me enhance my abilities by
        encouraging me to do things other kids would be doing and i would adapt
        and overcome the challenge and could usually keep up with my pairs
      </p>

        3.Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey. My strengths are my out the box thinking as well as my
        grit and determination. this will help me when I get stuck and need to
        keep working through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey? My
        limitations I often get bored working long hours and can get a little
        burnt out This might affect my excitement to work. I've been enjoying
        the hours so far, its difficult but rewardinng.
      </p>

        5.Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why. Me and others working at
        school on an english project one guy wasn't active in conversations and
        wasn't doing much work so I asked him to do a portion of the work by
        himself without our interference he did that part and we did our parts
        and added them together at the end this worked for everyone. It was very
        effective. Reflecting on it this strategy worked pretty well but only
        because this person wanted to pass and so was enticed to do work.
