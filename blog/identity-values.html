      Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice Growing up with
      a disability i had to think about how to do things with the abilities i
      had this resulted in my mind working in a methodical and logical way
      1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now. Ethical decision Cutting of
      a bully from my life He used to steal from all my friends and beat up
      another kid in friend group towards the end Had to weigh up letting a bad
      friend have no friends and peace for me and friends I reflect on it and
      that was the best option 2.Describe how your culture and the people around
      you have influenced your values and identity. My mum helped me enhance my
      abilities by encouraging me to do things other kids would be doing and i
      would adapt and overcome the challenge and could usually keep up with my
      pairs 3.Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
      learning journey. My strengths are my out the box thinking as well as my
      grit and determination 4.evaluate your limitations in terms of your
      learning and career development. How might these affect your learning
      journey? My limitations i often get bored working long hours and can get a
      little burnt out This might affect my excitement to work 5.Share an
      example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but
      there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time,
      how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you
      would try now and why. Me and others working at school on an english
      project one guy wasn't active in conversations and wasn't doing much work
      so i asked him to do a portion of the work by himself without our
      interference he did that part and we did our parts and added them together
      at the end this worked for everyone. It was very effective. Reflecting on
      it this strategy worked pretty well but only because this person wanted to
      pass and so was enticed to do work.
