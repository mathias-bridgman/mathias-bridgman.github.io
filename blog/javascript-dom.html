          think about making a chocolate chip cupcake.<br />
          <span>HTML</span> is the basic ingredients to the cupcake like the
          flour,eggs,sugar. the stuff that creates the main body .<br />
          <span> Javascript</span> is like the chocolate chips and the oven it
          gives it its abilities and its special features.<br />
          <span>CSS</span> is the frosting and sprinkles on the top its what
          determines whether something looks nice to your user.

        <h3>explaing control flow and loops</h3>
        <p>
          <span>control flow</span> is the way that a computer runs code like
          how people do things through the day like making then eating
          breakfast, then showering etc the pattern of what it does every time.
          there are three main types if/else statements which tests a boolean if
          its true it runs a ceartain peice of code and if its false it returns
          another this happens because the control list has a checklist if you
          will of everything it needs to do in order.<br />
          <span>loops</span> are a type of code in javascript that loops and
          repeats things the classic loop goes.<br />
          "for(let i=0 i <= 0 i++){"some code you want to run
          multiple(times)"}". <br />
          with a loop you can make it run as many times as you want by changing
          the value "i < 0" to something like "i <= 5" this would make the code
          run 5 times until the i is equal to 5, the i++ means that at the end
          of the code running it adds 1 to i so you can track how many times its
          run.

        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>
          the dom is like a family tree think of the main elements as the parent
          elements and the ones inside them are their children and so on. <br />
          to interact with the dom you usually use javascript and add, remove
          and modify elements on your page. an example of this is
          "document.getElementById('fillOrder').onclick = fillOrder " the first
          part "document.getelementbyid" is getting the "fillorder" element out
          of the html document its in. the "".onclick=fillorder" is what your
          telling the element you grabbed what to do so when clicked it calls
          the fill order function.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>arrays and objects</h5>
        <p>
          <span> arrays and objects</span> arrays are written like this
          "anarray: []" to interact with arrays.<br />
          you reference the index number ascociated with the value you want for
          example the index numbers look like "[0,1,2,3,4,5]".<br />
          an object works pretty similairly but is refferenced differently they
          ar refferenced by a key that you have set for the object.<br />
          its like the difference beetween getting a ceartain book in your
          favorite series by the book number like [arrays] and getting it by
          bookname like (objects).

        <h6>functions</h6>
        <p>
          <span> functions</span> are blocks of code that perform tasks you tell
          it to.<br />
          in the code above you can see the code 'add(num1, num2)' function isnt
          fully complete the return statement should have "num1 + num 2".<br />
          when this is called it adds whatever parameters have been put in place
          of "num1, num2" you would call it with add(1, 7) for example. when the
          functions called it will add those two parameters returning "8". they
          are helpful for when you want something to happen multiple times
          because you can just call the function where you want it and your good
          to go.
