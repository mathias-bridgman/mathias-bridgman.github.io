      Cultural blog: learning plan What is your long term goal or career
      pathway? My long term goal is to get a stable job in web development. I
      would also love to travel abroad and be able to do my job whilst there. A
      description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning My
      strength in learning is my perseverance as if I get stuck I just keep
      trying using all tools available for example I have been asking questions
      in discord as well as searching through tutorials and the material until I
      find the answer. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you
      like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I would like to
      develop my communication skills as I seem to fumble when talking to alot
      of people. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
      programme. This should include: I have been working productively by
      focusing on the work until im no longer absorbing the information aswell
      as I should (usually 1h 20m) then i take a 10 minute break. In order to
      work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives, I will respect everyone and will not
      discriminate against anybody for their opinions or beliefs. When things
      start building up and getting to me I will calm myself down and remind
      myself that I can do it. A commitment as to how and where you will seek
      help in a timely way When i get stuck for more than 15 minutes I will ask
      questions in the relevant discord channel or will request a facilitators
      help in a break out space. A description of what you expect from the
      Facilitation team I expect the facilitator team will assist me when I ask
      a question. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
      are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
      commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. I have
      no regular scheduling issues.
