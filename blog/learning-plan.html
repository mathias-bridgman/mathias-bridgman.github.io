        Cultural blog: learning plan What is your long term goal or career
        pathway? My long term goal is to get a stable job in web development. I
        would also love to travel abroad and be able to do my job whilst there.

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning My strength in learning is my perseverance as if I get stuck I
        just keep trying using all tools available for example I have been
        asking questions in discord as well as searching through tutorials and
        the material until I find the answer. A limitation I have is that coming
        straight from highschool I have been in the rythm of a 5 minute break
        while moving to class and large breaks every few hours. aswell as a set
        amount of hours per day, so working these longer hours was a shock to
        the system.

        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I would like to develop my
        communication skills as I seem to fumble when talking to alot of people.

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. I
        have been working productively by focusing on the work until im no
        longer absorbing the information aswell as I should (usually 1h 20m)
        then i take a 10 minute break.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to work productively and safely with other learners,
        Facilitators and industry/community representatives, I will respect
        everyone and will not discriminate against anybody for their opinions or
        beliefs. When things start building up and getting to me I will calm
        myself down and remind myself that I can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way When
        i get stuck for more than 15 minutes I will ask questions in the
        relevant discord channel or will request a facilitators help in a break
        out space.
      </p>

        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team I expect the
        facilitator team will assist me when I ask a question.

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. I
        have no regular scheduling issues.
