      <h1>bootcamp learning plan</h1>
      <p>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?<br />
        im hoping to get into the web development field and now think that
        something in game development could be interesting.<br />
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?<br />
        I think that my biggest strength in bootcamp will be my work ethic which
        has not changed much from what I thought in sprint 2.<br />
        my biggest weakness in bootcamp has definitelly changed from sprint 2
        and I now think that my biggest weakness is my focus drifting
        unintentionally.<br />
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?<br />
        <br />
        my biggest non technical challenge will probably be getting up and being
        at my computer pretty much entirely from 8:30 through until 5:30 this
        will be challenging as im used too being able to get up and take an hour
        off if I want too.<br />
        another challenge will probaly be presenting work too large groups as I
        get very nervous.<br />
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br />
        I would like to develop the same skills as in sprint2 but wouuld also
        like to learn how to present work too large and small groups<br /><br />
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?<br />
        i would like to be able to meet in online classrooms with facilitators
        to solve issues<br />
        I would also like to be taught about things im really struggling with
        when they arise.<br />
        <br />

        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?<br />
        I expect to complete my work in a timely manner and expect too try learn
        to the best of my abilities.<br />
        I will ask for help after giving myself 20 minutes to try solve it
        myself then wiull send a message in a thread or will message a
        facilitator directly to ask for help.<br />
        my commitment is the same as the one written in sprint 2.

        Cultural blog: learning plan What is your long term goal or career
        pathway? My long term goal is to get a stable job in web development. I
        would also love to travel abroad and be able to do my job whilst there.
      </p>
      <p>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning My strength in learning is my perseverance as if I get stuck I
        just keep trying using all tools available for example I have been
        asking questions in discord as well as searching through tutorials and
        the material until I find the answer. A limitation I have is that coming
        straight from highschool I have been in the rythm of a 5 minute break
        while moving to class and large breaks every few hours. aswell as a set
        amount of hours per day, so working these longer hours was a shock to
        the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I would like to develop my
        communication skills as I seem to fumble when talking to alot of people.

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. I
        have been working productively by focusing on the work until im no
        longer absorbing the information aswell as I should (usually 1h 20m)
        then i take a 10 minute break.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to work productively and safely with other learners,
        Facilitators and industry/community representatives, I will respect
        everyone and will not discriminate against anybody for their opinions or
        beliefs. When things start building up and getting to me I will calm
        myself down and remind myself that I can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way When
        i get stuck for more than 15 minutes I will ask questions in the
        relevant discord channel or will request a facilitators help in a break
        out space.
      </p>
      <p>
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team I expect the
        facilitator team will assist me when I ask a question.

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. I
        have no regular scheduling issues.
