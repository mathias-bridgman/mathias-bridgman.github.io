      <h1>problem solving blog</h1>
      <h2>A time I was stuck on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        <span>the problem</span> was that I had a function with a
        <span>for loop</span> in this for loop I needed to add an empty array
        like <code>let buzzyarr = [] </code> to my for loop inorder for it to
        work properly to give me an array back with the changes I wanted .<br />
        Inorder for me to solve this problem I asked my peers and teachers in
        the discord channel and I worked through the problem with them.<br />
        throughout the process of me figuring the problem out I felt annoyed
        that I couldnt figure it out at first, however when I figured it out I
        felt very relieved that i figured it out<br />
        whilst being stuck I learnt that there are a multitude of diffferent
        issues that can cause your problems not just syntax or spelling issues
        but also forgeting parts of functions and not having things in order.
      </p>

      <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        <span> the problem</span> was a
        <span><code>.find()</code></span> question where we had to find a
        variable called "scooby".<br />
        I used the prewritten tests to show me what I needed to write and I used
        some good google searches to help find what I needed aswell as good
        indentation which helped me to solve this problem when I misspelled
        something i likely would have struggled finding.<br />
        i felt good throughout doing this problem and I learnt alot about inline
        codeing while doing this problem.

      <h2>how confident I feel using these problem solving techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>psuedocode</span> I feel confident when writing it out however
          struggle to do it all the time as for some problems it feels tedious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>testing something</span>i am confident using this method as I do
          it often when doing my own code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>rubber ducky method</span>im not too confident using this method
          as I dont use it often
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>reading error messages</span> I feel confident reading error
          messages as I can understand most of the terminology that it
          communicates with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>console.logging</span> Im confident using console.log when
          testing my code as im writting
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>googling</span>im confident googling as I have learnt how to
          search for what I need to help me get unstuck
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>asking for help</span>im confident when asking peers and
          teachers as I know that others have or have had the same issues as me
          and can assist.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>improving with reflection</span>I feel like I do this well
          however I dont actively write my thoughts down
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help and why</h2>
      <p>
        the first few days I got stuck on pushing my repository to github. I was
        slightly nervous when asking for help because I thought my problems were
        easy fixes and I should just know it, but I realised quickly that thats
        not the case as we are all learning and cant be expected to know
        everything
