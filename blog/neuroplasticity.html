        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity is good for learners as they understand
          or can realise that although they don't know or understand a concept
          or idea doesn't mean they are dumb and instead they realise they just
          need to work at it and practice until they understand the skill.<br />
          An example of engaging in neuroplasticity in my life would be to do
          with videogames. When you start a game you don't even know the
          controls although most games share similar trigger and button
          values.<br />
          They almost never have the same techniques or even similar timing when
          it comes to doing things . So learning which ones to press comes with
          time. Often when starting a game my first few hours I will make
          mistakes because I haven't learnt what buttons to press to get the
          right attack or haven't learnt the timing on a dodge.<br />
          By the end of the game however I'm generally very good in comparison
          to the beginning of the game because of the constant practice and
          repetition. I also notice that when I leave a game for a while I lose
          the level of ability I previously had. But a quick recap jogs the
          memory and it takes substantially less time to rise up again.<br />
          A great way to increase your neuroplasticity is to practise repeatedly
          and frequently.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is where you can realise your not very good at
          something and instead of having a fixed mindset where you would think
          you can not get better and you won't be good at it you see your not
          the best but accept the challenge of getting better It's good to have
          a growth mindset as your more likely to do the work even when you
          don't understand it.<br />
          A growth mindset is all about determination. I realised whilst
          researching that I used to have an extremely fixed mindset and that it
          only really changed when I got to NCEA and I had to put a lot of
          effort in when I realised that doing something whilst not fully
          understanding is better than giving up or not giving it your all
          because you think youll never understand.<br />
          Im definitely integrating that growth mindset when working the past
          few weeks as ive been getting alot of information and not that much
          time to do it. so far i've been pretty good at using this mindset.

      <h2>how will this affect my learning plan</h2>
      <p>
        These will affect my learning plan as im going to integrate the growth
        mindset and my understanding of neuroplasticity into my learning plan
        and will actively remember these concepts to increase my effectiveness
        whilst learning.
